Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Simple Linear Regression model based on the area of the house. The dataset used includes features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad access, guestroom availability, basement, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, preferred area, and furnishing status, with 'price' as the target variable. First, missing values were handled by filling them with the mean of respective columns. The feature 'area' was selected to predict the 'price' of the house. The dataset was then split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio. A Simple Linear Regression model was trained using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression class. The model’s performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score. A regression line was also plotted to visualize the relationship between area and price. Tools used in this project include Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. This project also covers key Linear Regression interview questions related to assumptions, coefficient interpretation, evaluation metrics, multicollinearity, and the differences between simple and multiple regression models.
